There is limited research that examines the employment-related geographical mobility (E-RGM) of journeypersons in the construction industry.
Such an investigation is important because migration can help reduce labour shortages and surpluses and allow journeypersons to obtain gainful employment.
In this paper we investigate the E-RGM of construction industry journeypersons.
Drawing on data from the Education and Labour Market Longitudinal Platform (ELMLP) from 2008 to 2016, we find that while Ontario and Alberta gain the most migrants, the Atlantic region has more than 30% of its workforce that engages in E-RGM.
Of the most mobile trades are steamfitters and pipefitters, ironworkers, and construction trade helpers and labourers.
Moreover, those who are married, immigrants, and women are less likely to engage in E-RGM than are single journeypersons, non-immigrants, and men.
Red Seal trades or endorsements were associated with greater mobility; however, whether journeypersons were registered in their province of residence was the greatest predictor of mobility.
This finding suggests that while Red Seal programs have succeeded in creating standardised expectations across provinces and territories, place of residence has important implications for E-RGM of construction industry journeypersons.
These findings point to the need for more research that examines the root causes of migration.
Using data from Statistics Canadaâ€™s Education and Labour Market Longitudinal Platform (ELMLP), this study examines populations designated as visible minorities in the skilled trades.
The labour market outcomes, one year after certification, of journeypersons designated as visible minorities, who responded to the 2016 Census of Population and received certificates in the skilled trades between 2008 and 2017, were compared with the outcomes of journeypersons who are not visible minorities.
