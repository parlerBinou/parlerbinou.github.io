I made this interactive visualization tool based on [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).
It presents the data (Statistics Canada [Table 37-10-0204-01](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3710020401)) in a nice [Chord diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_diagram).  
Please not that this is not an official product from StatCan.

- [La version fran√ßaise](https://shiny.covid.cloud.statcan.ca/rais_siai/fr/)

All programs are available on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/parlerBinou/R-dashboards/tree/master/rais_siai).
