Recent immigrants in Canada can face challenges related to labour integration and a lack of recognition for their skills and experiences.Note  Previous studies have shown that Canadian postsecondary education could improve immigrants' labour market outcomes because this may lead to recognition of previously acquired skills and credentials.

Despite the importance of post-migration education, previous studies did not capture information about apprenticeship training or differentiate it from other types of postsecondary education. This article studies immigrants who obtained their certificates in the skilled trades after migration and compares their labour market outcomes with those of immigrants who took a different postsecondary educational pathway in Canada.Note  This can allow for a better understanding of the labour market integration of immigrants and the impact that Canadian education and training can have on their economic outcomes.
