My name is Hyeongsuk Jin.
Hyeongsuk is my given name, and Jin is my family name.

It's a Korean name and is written as 진형석[^1] in Korean characters.
I know that many people who don't speak Korean find my first name - Hyeongsuk - hard to read.[^2]

It's a name with two syllables - in the way syllables are counted in the Korean language, 'Hyeong 형' and 'suk 석'.
The first syllable, 'Hyeong,' sounds similar to the English word 'young,' but with the sound of 'h' in front of it, or a strong initial sound.
The second syllable, 'Suk,' sounds similar to the initial sound of the English word 'success.' (Well, I don't want to way it sounds similar to 'suck'.)

In case you really want to know what my name sounds like, you can copy my name, 형석, into [this website](https://papago.naver.com/) that has a pretty good Korean Text-to-Speach feature.

[^1]: In many Asian countries, including Korea, one's family name comes before the given name (see [this Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_name#Eastern_name_order)). My name in Korean letters is written in the order.

[^2]:I think it would be slightly easier to read for English speakers if it was anglicized as 'Hyongsuk.'
