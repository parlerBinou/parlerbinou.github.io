This analysis provides insight into the labour market outcomes of apprenticeship program discontinuers, focusing primarily on their industry of work and earnings by using data from the Education and Labour Market Longitudinal Platform and the 2016 Census of Population. 
Specifically, labour market outcomes were examined for those who registered in an apprenticeship program from 2008 to 2013 but discontinued their program without achieving certification.
