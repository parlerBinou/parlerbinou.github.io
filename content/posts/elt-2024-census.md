Using the Census of Population and the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey, this paper examines how the number and composition of tradespeople (specifically by age, gender, citizenship and choice of trade) have changed from 2016 to 2021 across Canada, and the degree to which labour shortages in the skilled trades may be experienced. 
Specifically, tradespeople employed in one of the Red Seal Trades on the Census of Population reference dates are studied.
