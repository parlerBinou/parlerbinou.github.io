Hi, I'm Hyeongsuk. ðŸ‘‹  
You can read a little bit more about my name in this [post](/posts/my-name).

I'm working as an analyst at Statistics Canada.  
At work, I study issues related to the registered apprenticeship programs in Canada.
I'm also working on some [data visualization projects](/tags/data-visualization).

I studied economics at Western University (aka the University of Western Ontario).  
In my [doctoral dissertation](/posts/Essays-on-Family-Economics.md), I studied decisions the family makes regarding household unions, fertility, and child investment.

This is a personal portfolio of projects I worked on at work --- together with colleagues in most cases --- and personally.
