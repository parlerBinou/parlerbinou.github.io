      <description>This is my doctoral dissertation, which took so much longer time than I planned. The copy is available through Western University library.
 This thesis studies decisions the family makes regarding household unions, fertility, and child investment. Chapter 2 studies the educational gradient in non-marital fertility and posits that cohabitation is a driver behind the gradient. I build a lifecycle model of fertility and household union choices, featuring a trade-off between quality and quantity of children.</description>

      <title>My Name</title>

      <description>My name is Hyeongsuk Jin. Hyeongsuk is my given name, and Jin is my family name.
It&amp;rsquo;s a Korean name and is written as 진형석1 in Korean characters. I know that many people who don&amp;rsquo;t speak Korean find my first name - Hyeongsuk - hard to read.2
It&amp;rsquo;s a name with two syllables - in the way syllables are counted in the Korean language, &amp;lsquo;Hyeong 형&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;suk 석&amp;rsquo;. The first syllable, &amp;lsquo;Hyeong,&amp;rsquo; sounds similar to the English word &amp;lsquo;young,&amp;rsquo; but with the sound of &amp;lsquo;h&amp;rsquo; in front of it, or a strong initial sound.</description>
