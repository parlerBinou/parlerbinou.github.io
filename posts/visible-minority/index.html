Using data from Statistics Canada’s Education and Labour Market Longitudinal Platform (ELMLP), this study examines populations designated as visible minorities in the skilled trades. The labour market outcomes, one year after certification, of journeypersons designated as visible minorities, who responded to the 2016 Census of Population and received certificates in the skilled trades between 2008 and 2017, were compared with the outcomes of journeypersons who are not visible minorities."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://parlerbinou.github.io/posts/visible-minority/><link href=/assets/css/stylesheet.min.d08f6c302eba3eaecd589684c093cecdfe7dfb8745a207401bd0583d3bb31837.css integrity="sha256-0I9sMC66Pq7NWJaEwJPOzf59+4dFogdAG9BYPTuzGDc=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://parlerbinou.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://parlerbinou.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://parlerbinou.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://parlerbinou.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://parlerbinou.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.110.0"><meta property="og:title" content="Labour market outcomes of journeypersons designated as visible minorities"><meta property="og:description" content="This article, coauthored with Sophia Su, is published on Statistics Canada&rsquo;s Education, learning and training: Research Paper Series.

However, the degrees of under-representation varied across population groups. For both men and women, compared to other designated groups, Latin Americans were less under-represented, and Chinese were more under-represented. One year after certification, journeypersons in most designated groups had lower median employment incomes than those who were not a visible minority. However, the labour market outcomes varied substantially across population groups. Trades in which visible minority journeypersons certified compared to non-visible minorities showed differences. For men, automotive service technician was more common in all designated groups than in non-visible minorities. Similarly, cook was also more common in most designated groups, with the exception of Black men. Most visible minority journeypersons received their certificates in Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia. Compared to non-visible minority journeypersons, a larger proportion was certified in Ontario, whereas Quebec was under-represented. For men, about the half of the differences in median employment incomes between visible minority and non-visible minority journeypersons could be explained by different characteristics, such as trade, geography, and the mode of certification. However, this was not the case for women.
