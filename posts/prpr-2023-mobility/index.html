 There is a growing body of literature examining both apprenticeship training and journeypersons, because of the ability of these programs to facilitate and maintain a skilled workforce. However, there remains a gap in the literature on the internal migration patterns of these journeypersons from a life course perspective. In this article, we deploy a life course approach and draw on data from the Education and Labour Market Longitudinal Platform (ELMLP) from 2008 to 2016 to establish the in- and out-migration patterns of journeypersons in Canada between Economic Regions (ER) in all provinces and territories."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://parlerbinou.github.io/posts/prpr-2023-mobility/><link href=/assets/css/stylesheet.min.e7fdcebb37aa7bdecf8b9159a8b3cab1ba4a084f27d375288d3416558b340888.css integrity="sha256-5/3Ouzeqe97Pi5FZqLPKsbpKCE8n03UojTQWVYs0CIg=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://parlerbinou.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://parlerbinou.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://parlerbinou.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://parlerbinou.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://parlerbinou.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.79.1"><meta property="og:title" content="The Geographical Mobility of Journeypersons in Canada: Evidence from Administrative Data"><meta property="og:description" content="This paper, coauthored with Michael Haan and Paul Taylor at Western University, is published on Population Research and Policy Review.
