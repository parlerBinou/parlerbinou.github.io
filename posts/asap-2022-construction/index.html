There is limited research that examines the employment-related geographical mobility (E-RGM) of journeypersons in the construction industry. Such an investigation is important because migration can help reduce labour shortages and surpluses and allow journeypersons to obtain gainful employment. In this paper we investigate the E-RGM of construction industry journeypersons.
