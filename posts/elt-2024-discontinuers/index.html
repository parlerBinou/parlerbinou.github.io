This analysis provides insight into the labour market outcomes of apprenticeship program discontinuers, focusing primarily on their industry of work and earnings by using data from the Education and Labour Market Longitudinal Platform and the 2016 Census of Population. Specifically, labour market outcomes were examined for those who registered in an apprenticeship program from 2008 to 2013 but discontinued their program without achieving certification."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://parlerbinou.github.io/posts/elt-2024-discontinuers/><link href=/assets/css/stylesheet.min.d08f6c302eba3eaecd589684c093cecdfe7dfb8745a207401bd0583d3bb31837.css integrity="sha256-0I9sMC66Pq7NWJaEwJPOzf59+4dFogdAG9BYPTuzGDc=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://parlerbinou.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://parlerbinou.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://parlerbinou.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://parlerbinou.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://parlerbinou.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.110.0"><meta property="og:title" content="Discontinuers of apprenticeship programs: An analysis on the impact of discontinuation on the labour market outcomes of apprentices"><meta property="og:description" content="This paper, coauthored with Justin Brown and Sophia Su, is published on Statistics Canada&rsquo;s Education, learning and training: Research Paper Series.
