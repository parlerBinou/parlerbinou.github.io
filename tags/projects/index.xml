      <title>The Mobility of Construction Workers in Canada: Insights from Administrative Data</title>

      <description>This paper, coauthored with Michael Haan and Paul Taylor at Western University, is published on Applied Spatial Analysis and Policy.
 There is limited research that examines the employment-related geographical mobility (E-RGM) of journeypersons in the construction industry. Such an investigation is important because migration can help reduce labour shortages and surpluses and allow journeypersons to obtain gainful employment. In this paper we investigate the E-RGM of construction industry journeypersons. Drawing on data from the Education and Labour Market Longitudinal Platform (ELMLP) from 2008 to 2016, we find that while Ontario and Alberta gain the most migrants, the Atlantic region has more than 30% of its workforce that engages in E-RGM.</description>

Using data from Statistics Canada’s Education and Labour Market Longitudinal Platform (ELMLP), this study examines populations designated as visible minorities in the skilled trades. The labour market outcomes, one year after certification, of journeypersons designated as visible minorities, who responded to the 2016 Census of Population and received certificates in the skilled trades between 2008 and 2017, were compared with the outcomes of journeypersons who are not visible minorities.</description>

      <title>Essays on Family Economics</title>
      <link>https://parlerbinou.github.io/posts/essays-on-family-economics/</link>

      <description>This is my doctoral dissertation, which took so much longer time than I planned. The copy is available through Western University library.
 This thesis studies decisions the family makes regarding household unions, fertility, and child investment. Chapter 2 studies the educational gradient in non-marital fertility and posits that cohabitation is a driver behind the gradient. I build a lifecycle model of fertility and household union choices, featuring a trade-off between quality and quantity of children.</description>
