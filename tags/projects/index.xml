      <description>This is my doctoral dissertation, which took so much longer time than I planned. The copy is available through Western University library.
 This thesis studies decisions the family makes regarding household unions, fertility, and child investment. Chapter 2 studies the educational gradient in non-marital fertility and posits that cohabitation is a driver behind the gradient. I build a lifecycle model of fertility and household union choices, featuring a trade-off between quality and quantity of children.</description>
