      <title>Discontinuers of apprenticeship programs: An analysis on the impact of discontinuation on the labour market outcomes of apprentices</title>

      <description>This paper, coauthored with Justin Brown and Sophia Su, is published on Statistics Canada&amp;rsquo;s Education, learning and training: Research Paper Series.
This analysis provides insight into the labour market outcomes of apprenticeship program discontinuers, focusing primarily on their industry of work and earnings by using data from the Education and Labour Market Longitudinal Platform and the 2016 Census of Population. Specifically, labour market outcomes were examined for those who registered in an apprenticeship program from 2008 to 2013 but discontinued their program without achieving certification.</description>

      <description>This paper, coauthored with Amanda Kopp, is published on Statistics Canada&amp;rsquo;s Education, learning and training: Research Paper Series.
Recent immigrants in Canada can face challenges related to labour integration and a lack of recognition for their skills and experiences.Note Previous studies have shown that Canadian postsecondary education could improve immigrants&amp;rsquo; labour market outcomes because this may lead to recognition of previously acquired skills and credentials.
Despite the importance of post-migration education, previous studies did not capture information about apprenticeship training or differentiate it from other types of postsecondary education.</description>

      <title>The Geographical Mobility of Journeypersons in Canada: Evidence from Administrative Data</title>
      <link>https://parlerbinou.github.io/posts/prpr-2023-mobility/</link>

      <description>This paper, coauthored with Michael Haan and Taylor Paul at Western University, is published on Population Research and Policy Review.
There is a growing body of literature examining both apprenticeship training and journeypersons, because of the ability of these programs to facilitate and maintain a skilled workforce. However, there remains a gap in the literature on the internal migration patterns of these journeypersons from a life course perspective. In this article, we deploy a life course approach and draw on data from the Education and Labour Market Longitudinal Platform (ELMLP) from 2008 to 2016 to establish the in- and out-migration patterns of journeypersons in Canada between Economic Regions (ER) in all provinces and territories.</description>

      <title>The Mobility of Construction Workers in Canada: Insights from Administrative Data</title>

      <description>This paper, coauthored with Michael Haan and Taylor Paul at Western University, is published on Applied Spatial Analysis and Policy.
There is limited research that examines the employment-related geographical mobility (E-RGM) of journeypersons in the construction industry. Such an investigation is important because migration can help reduce labour shortages and surpluses and allow journeypersons to obtain gainful employment. In this paper we investigate the E-RGM of construction industry journeypersons. Drawing on data from the Education and Labour Market Longitudinal Platform (ELMLP) from 2008 to 2016, we find that while Ontario and Alberta gain the most migrants, the Atlantic region has more than 30% of its workforce that engages in E-RGM.</description>

Using data from Statistics Canada’s Education and Labour Market Longitudinal Platform (ELMLP), this study examines populations designated as visible minorities in the skilled trades. The labour market outcomes, one year after certification, of journeypersons designated as visible minorities, who responded to the 2016 Census of Population and received certificates in the skilled trades between 2008 and 2017, were compared with the outcomes of journeypersons who are not visible minorities.</description>

      <title>Essays on Family Economics</title>

      <description>This is my doctoral dissertation, which took so much longer time than I planned. The copy is available through Western University library.
This thesis studies decisions the family makes regarding household unions, fertility, and child investment. Chapter 2 studies the educational gradient in non-marital fertility and posits that cohabitation is a driver behind the gradient. I build a lifecycle model of fertility and household union choices, featuring a trade-off between quality and quantity of children.</description>

      <description>My name is Hyeongsuk Jin. Hyeongsuk is my given name, and Jin is my family name.
It&amp;rsquo;s a Korean name and is written as 진형석1 in Korean characters. I know that many people who don&amp;rsquo;t speak Korean find my first name - Hyeongsuk - hard to read.2
It&amp;rsquo;s a name with two syllables - in the way syllables are counted in the Korean language, &amp;lsquo;Hyeong 형&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;suk 석&amp;rsquo;. The first syllable, &amp;lsquo;Hyeong,&amp;rsquo; sounds similar to the English word &amp;lsquo;young,&amp;rsquo; but with the sound of &amp;lsquo;h&amp;rsquo; in front of it, or a strong initial sound.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Hyeongsuk. 👋
You can read a little bit more about my name in this post.
I&amp;rsquo;m working as an analyst at Statistics Canada.
At work, I study issues related to the registered apprenticeship programs in Canada. I&amp;rsquo;m also working on some data visualization projects.
I studied economics at Western University (aka the University of Western Ontario).
In my doctoral dissertation, I studied decisions the family makes regarding household unions, fertility, and child investment.</description>
