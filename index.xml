Using data from Statistics Canada‚Äôs Education and Labour Market Longitudinal Platform (ELMLP), this study examines populations designated as visible minorities in the skilled trades. The labour market outcomes, one year after certification, of journeypersons designated as visible minorities, who responded to the 2016 Census of Population and received certificates in the skilled trades between 2008 and 2017, were compared with the outcomes of journeypersons who are not visible minorities.</description>

      <title>Essays on Family Economics</title>
      <link>https://parlerbinou.github.io/posts/essays-on-family-economics/</link>

      <description>This is my doctoral dissertation, which took so much longer time than I planned. The copy is available through Western University library.
 This thesis studies decisions the family makes regarding household unions, fertility, and child investment. Chapter 2 studies the educational gradient in non-marital fertility and posits that cohabitation is a driver behind the gradient. I build a lifecycle model of fertility and household union choices, featuring a trade-off between quality and quantity of children.</description>

      <description>My name is Hyeongsuk Jin. Hyeongsuk is my given name, and Jin is my family name.
It&amp;rsquo;s a Korean name and is written as ÏßÑÌòïÏÑù1 in Korean characters. I know that many people who don&amp;rsquo;t speak Korean find my first name - Hyeongsuk - hard to read.2
It&amp;rsquo;s a name with two syllables - in the way syllables are counted in the Korean language, &amp;lsquo;Hyeong Ìòï&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;suk ÏÑù&amp;rsquo;. The first syllable, &amp;lsquo;Hyeong,&amp;rsquo; sounds similar to the English word &amp;lsquo;young,&amp;rsquo; but with the sound of &amp;lsquo;h&amp;rsquo; in front of it, or a strong initial sound.</description>
